# Restaurant-Management-Application

Designed and developed a restaurant management application for a restaurant that enables user authentication with two
types of users (employees and admins), allowing admins to manage employee accounts and the restaurant menu. Implemented functionalities include order recording, status tracking, stock management. The application only features the Backend part, it is structured using Layers design architecture and includes
authentication with encrypted passwords. The project is a good way to learn and implement CRUD operations and manage users.
